<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="bio photo" class="smaller imgcenter">
<div class="aboutcontainer">
  <p>I'm originally from the Bay Area and, now, I am a student at Cornell University. I study Information Science in the college
    of Arts and Sciences with concentrations in UX Design and Interactive Technologies.</p>
  <p>I believe that novel ideas can bring about the next big thing to impact people lives. I even
  believe that through tweaking a few things in an existing design can make individuals want to use
  the item in their everyday life. Just like how the computer went from large bulky machines that only a few people knew
  how to use to becoming light weight machines that almost everyone knows how to use. For it is the combination of innovative thought
  and thoughtful design is a combination for success.</p>
  <p>When I'm not rambling off about the importance of thoughtful design you can find me out in nature enjoying my photography
  hobby with my 9lb dog by my side.</p>
