    <h1>Improving SAP Center: Simplifying the decision to the question, “What do you want to eat?”</h1>
    <p>Digital Tools Used: sketch, Principle for Mac, and Photoshop</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>I’m a San Jose Sharks fan and when ever I’m home I find myself at SAP Center ready to cheer on the Sharks. Getting to the game is easy. The difficult part is when I get there. The decision process of deciding what to eat is always an elaborate dance. My brother and I will just wander around the stadium just looking for a place to eat.</p>
    <p>Yet, we get tired of wandering. All we want to do is EAT! So, we end up just eating at the same exact hamburger place everytime. It’s not because it’s spectacular or reasonably priced. It’s because we know where it is and the quality we get.</p>
    <p>The difficulty comes with not knowing what the stadium has to offer to eat. The strategy most people probably have is just wandering around the stadium until they find something that looks tasty. If you think about it the stadium is probably losing out on money with people not knowing what is there. Since if people don’t know their dining options how will they ever buy?
There must be an easier way to find food to enjoy while watching the game.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
    Before creating my own solution I wanted to see if my answers for an easier way to know what SAP Center has for dining options had already been solved.
    Naturally, I went to the SAP Center website.
    Easily found the page for “Arena Food and Beverage.”
    There are two PDFs for the two levels of the stadium that show a map and list of the different vendors, which you can see for yourself at this
    <a href="http://www.sapcenter.com/www.sapcenter.com/guest-services/arena-food-beverage">link</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the desktop it looks alright.
    You can easily see the name of vendors and its location on the map.
    However, attendees are probably more likely to look at this website on their phone when they’re at the game!
    Attendees are busy with their own lives and deciding what to eat at SAP Center during their day to day activities is the last of their priorities.
    It’s when you’re at the crowded stadium starting to become a little hangry that you think about what you’re going to eat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking at the “Arena Food and Beverage” page from the SAP Center website on your phone strains your eyes.
    Since the maps are PDFs users have to zoom in to the page just to clearly see the name of vendors and then horizontally scroll to attempt to find the vendor on the map.
    It’s not an efficient process. It’s tedious.
  </p>

  <p>
    After, using the website on my phone I thought maybe the SAP Center has an app!
    Well, they sort of do. But, it isn’t just called “SAP Center.”
    The app is called “San Jose Sharks + SAP Center,” which isn’t the greatest.
    Since in my personal opinion the SAP Center should have its own app, rather than have it be connected to the Sharks because what if you are at the SAP Center for a concert instead of a Sharks game.
    This brings up other problems.
    Yet, for the purposes of this case study as a Sharks fan this app being connected to the SAP Center does work for the target audience of Sharks fans.
    The Sharks app didn’t even list the names of individual vendors.
